This is an Ant BuildListener that will display build notifications via Growl/JGrowl.

Prerequisites:

* The growllistener jar
* The JGrowl jar (binaryblizzard.jar)
* JGrowl (Linux) (http://homepage.mac.com/stevevm/JGrowl/JGrowl.tar.gz)
* Growl (Mac OS X only) (http://growl.info)

Setting things up in Mac OS with Growl:

* Make sure the following settings are enabled in Growl's Network preferences:
  * "Listen for incoming notifications"
  * "Allow remote application registration"
* Put growllistener.jar into Ant's lib directory
* Put binaryblizzard.jar (From JGrowl) into Ant's lib directory
* To make ant use the new listener, invoke ant like this:
  * ant -listener net.slimeslurp.growl.GrowlListner
  * You could also add "-listener net.slimeslurp.growl.GrowlListener" to your ANT_OPTS environment variable

Setting things up in Linux with JGrowl:

* Startup JGrowl
* Put growllistener.jar into Ant's lib directory
* Put binaryblizzard.jar (From JGrowl) into Ant's lib directory
* To make ant use the new listener, invoke ant like this:
  * ant -listener net.slimeslurp.growl.GrowlListner
